The application was developed to address the need for simple, secure, and persistent inventory management from a mobile device. It allows users to create an account, log in, and manage items through complete create, read, update, and delete operations, all backed by an SQLite database. In addition, the app includes SMS alerts when an item reaches a low inventory level, without compromising its core functionality if the user chooses not to grant this permission, thus ensuring flexibility and a user-centered experience.

During development, the approach was based on structured and progressive programming, combining constant testing on the Android Studio emulator with best practices in design and coding. Priority was given to code clarity, separation of concerns between classes, and an intuitive interface that facilitated navigation. Throughout the process, it was necessary to adjust both the authentication logic and permission handling to ensure stability and usability. The greatest achievement was reflected in the integration between the database, the graphical interface, and the conditional notifications, demonstrating a solid understanding of the complete mobile application development lifecycle.
